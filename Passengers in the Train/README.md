A train leaves the first station with N passengers and visits K stations before it arrives at the last station. 
In each station some passengers get off the train and others get on the train. All the people in the train get off at the last station.

question:
Make a program that calculates how many passengers get off the train at the last station.

Input specification:
The first line of the input has two integers K and N where 0 ≤ (K and N) ≤ 1000. 
Each of the following K lines contain two integers (between 0 and 1000), the first one denotes the number of passengers who get off and
the second one denotes the number of passengers get on the train at that station.

Output specification:
